# 📝 To-Do List PWA

> "Productivity isn't just about getting stuff done — it's about slaying tasks with style."

A sleek, animated, and priority-powered To-Do List built with vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript — now converted into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with desktop widget support! No frameworks, no fluff — just vibes, functionality, and modern PWA features.
